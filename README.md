# [JSL04]: Monster Ternary Operator
 
## Project Overview<br>
In this project, we were tasked to work with the Monster Ternary Operator to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. The ternary operator was used to decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic and the importance to use the ternary operator judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.

## Ternary Operator Overview <br>
The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a simplified conditional operator like if/else. It provides a way to make decisions based on a condition and choose between two options. <br>
The syntax for the ternary operator is:
<br>

`let result = condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`

## Challeges
The one challege, which i faced was how to code using tenary operator, but i started to do the if statement for the challeges and then i translated the if statement code to tenary operator, as it was the easy way for me to understand and do it.

## ðŸ“š What I learned <br>
Working with the Monster Ternary Operator provided a practical understanding of leveraging concise conditional logic to make decisions based on specific conditions, and I gained valuable insights into best practices in this challeges.
